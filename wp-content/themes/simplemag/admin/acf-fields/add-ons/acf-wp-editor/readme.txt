Adds a native WordPress WYSIWYG field to the Advanced Custom Fields plugin. Please note this field does not work as a sub field

== Description ==

Adds a native WordPress WYSIWYG field to the Advanced Custom Fields plugin. 

This field uses the native wp_editor function which creates a very native looking WYSWYG field. The only downside to this field is that it does not work within a repeater field when adding a new row. Saving the post and reloading the edit screen will allow the field to render correctly and continue to work as expected.

* version 5
* version 4
* version 3
